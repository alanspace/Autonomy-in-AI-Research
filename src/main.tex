\begin{abstract}
This paper investigates the profound question of whether artificial systems, particularly humanoid robots enhanced by large language models (LLMs), can genuinely exhibit consciousness, subjective experience, or philosophical autonomy. Drawing on an interdisciplinary analysis of philosophical arguments, technical capabilities, and ethical considerations, this work interrogates the applicability of these human-centric concepts to non-biological intelligence. We argue that while contemporary AI demonstrates an impressive capacity for simulating complex human-like behaviors, a critical distinction persists between this sophisticated mimicry and the authentic, self-derived emergence of these phenomena. The paper explores this simulation-reality gap, examines the limitations of current AI in achieving genuine consciousness or true autonomy, and discusses the significant societal and ethical implications that arise from the convincing appearance of these qualities, ultimately advocating for a stance of reasoned caution and clear human accountability in the development and deployment of advanced AI.
