## Abstract
This paper investigates the "simulation-reality gap" in contemporary humanoid robots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that while behavioral mimicry is reaching unprecedented levels of fidelity, a fundamental distinction persists between sophisticated simulation and authentic philosophical autonomy. This work evaluates the ethical implications of this convergence, specifically focusing on human accountability and AI welfare.

- **Source Files**: LaTeX source code for the manuscript.

## Key Research Themes
- **The Simulation-Reality Gap:** Analysis of why mimicry != autonomy.
- **AI Welfare & Moral Patienthood:** Proposing evaluative metrics for non-biological sentience.
- **Accountability Frameworks:** Defining human responsibility in the deployment of autonomous agents.

## Appendix: A Brief History of AI and Robotics
A historical context of the field, from Asimov’s Three Laws and the 1955 Dartmouth Proposal to the current era of Deep Learning and humanoid embodiment, is included in the final section of the paper.
